WorldInventories
=======================

Provided with no guarantee whatsoever. I've tested it a lot on my server and the code's here if you want to check it over.

Simply put WorldInventories in the Bukkit plugins folder, run it once, edit the config file it creates. An example is included so it should be self-explanatory.

The first time you teleport in to a new world group it will wipe the items you had! There's not really a better way of doing this.
